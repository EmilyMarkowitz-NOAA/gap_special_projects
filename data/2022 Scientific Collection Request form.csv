Because it is unlikely that these two assumptions are always met, there is interest in evaluating other approaches for the positive identification of lamprey hosts.  For this project, we would like to evaluate the contents from the digestive tracts of adult Arctic and Pacific lampreys to determine the potential for using genetic characteristics of consumed blood and/or tissues as well as hard structures (e.g., scales, otoliths, etc.) to identify fish hosts.  The objective of this research will be to determine if using a combination of consumed blood, tissues, and hard structures from the digestive tracts of adult Arctic and Pacific lamprey will allow for the positive identification of their fish hosts/prey.

While bottom trawl data is the current “gold standard” for estimating fish distributions and abundance, this method is extremely resource intensive and important areas cannot be surveyed due to logistical constraints. Additionally, some areas cannot be assessed with a bottom trawl because of habitat characteristics (i.e., untrawlable habitat). Environmental DNA (eDNA) could potentially be used to increase the scope of bottom trawl surveys in trawlable areas and to sample untrawlable habitat. A validation study pairing trawl data and eDNA samples can be used to calibrate eDNA with bottom trawl data to develop a method for integration of these two data types. Once this validation is complete, eDNA can be used to sample untrawlable habitats, which are data poor and sources of uncertainty in evaluating EFH and for stock assessments in general. We aim to compare the species distribution and relative abundance identified by eDNA with those data obtained from paired bottom trawl samples and then build on this validation study by collecting eDNA samples from untrawlable habitats. It is vital that we sample in 2022 to conduct this comparison because we are aiming to deploy eDNA in tandem with drop cameras on the funded 2023 untrawlable habitat survey. If we are not able to sample this year, we will not be able to leverage the large number of sea days funded on the 2023 survey, representing a major missed opportunity.

eDNA will be collected each day for the 15 days of the survey leg using a single 10-L Niskin bottle. All 10 L will be filtered on board and filters will be preserved in Longmire buffer (room temperature stable and non hazmat). Ideally, eDNA will be sampled in the morning before trawling begins but could be sampled at another more convenient time. We plan to sample with a small winch that can be operated by 1 person. The niskin will be lowered to the bottom, reeled up ~10 turns, and the niskin will be triggered with a messenger. When the sample is on board, we will filter 3 3 L replicates. This should take ~10 minutes.

A recent shift in the estimated summer time biomass of Pacific cod has raised several important questions including if Pacific cod found in the NBS during the summer are residents who overwinter in the NBS area and/or spawn locally. Our main objective will be to use pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) to track the long-term movement patterns (up to 1 year) of fish tagged during the NMFS 2020 summer survey in the NBS. Genetic information for each of these tagged fish will be collected and used to estimate the birthplace for each fish.
In addition, information on Pacific cod maturity during the winter fishery will be collected through the observer program and used to determine the reproductive statuses of the population in different locations. Finally, a collaborative project with the St. Lawrence native fishing community will be established to assist in tagging efforts and to record data throughout the year on Pacific cod landed in the region, including cod captured under the ice and the recording of large mortality events as have been described by members of this community. Outreach done through our partnership with commercial fishermen in the Bering Sea will also help to ensure that any cod equipped with tags from this study that are caught by industry will be returned so data from the tags can be recovered.

At the end of the survey leg, crabs should be consolidated to one vessel for packing if possible. Crab will be packed in coolers while vessels are in port at the conclusion of the survey leg. Coolers will be transported back to Kodiak as checked baggage, as the coolers tend to get higher priority for loading and better chance of being transferred to a connecting flight in Anchorage. 
Time to conduct the above-described sampling will be variable depending on catch rates of target crab at each survey station. In general, the sampling time should be ~15 min per survey station to evaluate crab status (chela size, BES condition) for potential retention and placement in deck tanks.

First identified in 2017, this condition, named black eye syndrome (BES), is characterized by subtle changes in eye pigmentation in the eyestalk in early stages, and lesions, loss of function, retinal collapse and erosion of the eyestalk in later stages. Preliminary histological assessments have not identified a single causative agent, and the pathology at later stages suggests that a shift in the microbial community may play a role. The goal of this collection is to characterize BES pathology, the eyestalk microbiome in healthy and diseased small-clawed male snow crabs,  and to quantify gene expression within the eyestalk to understand physiological implications of this syndrome. For both ‘omic’ (transcriptomic and microbiome analysis) and histological analyses, collections of 25 eyestalks from small clawed male snow crabs per each of five BES severity stages (250 crab eyestalks total), is planned for legs 2 and 3 of the 2022 NOAA survey. We request to collect crabs during the NOAA trawl survey in 2022 as this aligns with our NPRB grant, and snow crab with BES have previously been identified in the survey area and during the time of collection.

To minimize confounding from spatial differences, samples from healthy crabs should be collected from the same locations as diseased crabs. 

Sampling protocol: 
All samples: Live snow crabs captured from the 2022 NOAA survey displaying BES (see accompanying BES stage guide) will be assessed for any additional gross pathologies or exterior shell damage, sexed and measured. All accompanying data (ex. left or right eye, severity of BES, capture location, depth, water temperature) will be recorded on attached datasheet.  We request 25 eyestalks of each stage (0-4, see accompanying BES stage guide) for each of the following 2 experiments (i.e., 125 eyestalks for each experiment). It is fine to harvest both eyestalks from a single crab, provided that one is used for histology and one is used for microbiome work- this should be noted on the datasheet 

Histological samples: Prior to the onset of sampling several 250-ml containers (provided) should be partially filled with Bouin’s solution such that any histology cassette (containing an eyestalk) placed in this container will be fully submerged in the solution. Note that it is critical that sampled tissues be fully submerged for appropriate fixation-adjust volumes of fixative depending on the number of cassettes in each 250-ml container. High resolution macrophotographs of eyestalks from crabs displaying BES stages 0-4 will be taken (using an Olympus Tough TG digital camera or similar) at sea prior to removal of the eyestalk. A label (provided) and ruler should be included in each photo. Eyestalks will be carefully excised (at the base of the eyestalk using a scalpel) and placed in a pre-labelled tissue cassette which will then be closed and fully submerged in the 250-ml container containing Bouin’s solution for 48hrs. After 48 hr, the tissue cassettes will then be transferred and submerged into a 1-L container containing 70% ethanol (using supplied disposable forceps) for storage. Used Bouin’s solution should be carefully poured into the original bottle (using a funnel) and returned to shore for appropriate disposal. The containers can be reused for fixation of additional samples (use fresh Bouin’s solution). 4L of Bouin’s solution is supplied and should be sufficient to easily fix ~125 eyestalk samples. Unused Bouin’s should remain in the original containers and be retained at the Kodiak Fisheries Research Center for future BES laboratory experiment sampling (see Ben Daly, ADFG). Note that the used Bouin’s can be reused if the at-sea sampler runs out of original fixative. Fixed eyestalks can remain at room temperature and can be picked up at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle.  

Hazards and PPE: Care should be taken when handling a scalpel blade. Bouin’s solution contains picric acid and formaldehyde (see the accompanying material safety data sheet) and appropriate care (ex. wearing laboratory coat, gloves and eye protection) should be taken when handling this liquid. Forceps will be provided for handling the tissue cassettes when transferring between Bouin’s solution and 70% ethanol. Non-disposable equipment should be washed in soap and iodine at the end of the sampling.

RNA samples: 3 mL screw cap tubes prefilled with 1.5 mL of RNALater solution and pre-labelled will be provided. For each sample, the eyestalk will be removed with a sterile scalpel and forceps, and immediately submerged in the appropriate tube of RNALater. It is important that the sample is fully submerged. The forceps and scalpel should be cleaned and flamed with ethanol immediately prior to sampling. Non-disposable equipment should be washed in soap and iodine at the end of the sampling. Samples can remain at room temperature and will be picked up at the Alaska Fisheries Research Center in Seattle. We request 25 eyestalks of each stage (0-4, be preserved in this manner.) It is important to reduce heterogeneity in sample collection (e.g., spatial, handling, etc). Efforts to collects samples in as few locations as possible and to standardize sampling procedures (e.g., time spent on deck prior to sampling), should be made when possible. We realize that there are many tasks to complete on this survey and some variation in collection processes is unavoidable. 

Hazards and PPE: Gloves should be worn while handling RNALater. Please do not use bleach or other hypochlorite solutions to clean forceps and scalpels, as it can react with RNALater.

An initial capture condition based on a published scale from ‘Excellent’ to ‘Dead on Arrival’ would be assigned to a fish of interest, and a blood and mucus sample would be collected. Immediate analyses of the blood would include a pH reading using a portable waterproof pH meter (Hanna Instruments HI99161), and a lactate reading using a Lactate Pro meter (HaB Direct BS48302). The blood and mucus can then be stored on deck in a small cooler with ice packs until the survey data collection has ceased, at which time the mucus can be stored in the freezer, and the glucose concentration of the blood can be analyzed using a Glucometer (ACCU-CHECK).

disease, movement and recruitment as well as optimal habitats and ecosystem health. Currently many scientists use length–weight as a proxy for fish condition. This is primarily out of convenience as this data is routinely collected during the RACE groundfish surveys and thousands of observations are available for a host of species. However there are some key assumptions with this method including weight errors (accurate scales on moving vessels) and stomach contents that affect this index. We are proposing a study to examine a variety of methods to ground-truth the length-weight method and develop a quick accurate, meaningful method to collect fish condition data at sea that is independent of length or weight measurements and their associated errors. We propose using a device called a Fatmeter to monitor fish fat content while at sea and collect samples of pollock and cod if possible to do further chemical analysis in a laboratory to further validate the at sea measurements. Laboratory analysis will include bomb calorimetry, proximate composition, Fatmeter, and Near Infraredspectroscopy. This project is funded  through  EFH. We currently own 6 Fatmeters and this would compliment data that were collected in 2019 and 2021. We would be collecting additional fatmeter data during this cruise as well as frozen specimens of pollock and cod.

In the Aleutian Islands (AI), over 125 species (or subspecies) of deep-water sponges have been identified to date, but it is estimated that several hundred additional sponge species have yet to be described in the region. The purpose of the project is to create a voucher collection for sponges for later identification by taxonomic experts and for genetic sequencing (PCR with 28s and COI markers). The Groundfish Assessment Program has positively contributed to our efforts to establish a reference collection in the past; this year, we are seeking small numbers of individuals from taxa that are underrepresented or absent from our reference collection. 

This study addresses priorities identified by the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council and NOAA’s Deep Sea Coral Research and Technology Program’s (DSCRTP) Alaska Initiative Science Plan by improving Species Identifications and supporting the collection of environmental DNA (eDNA) data. This year there is additional priority to our request, as we have already secured funding from DSCRTP to process the requested specimens. The molecular barcode collections are also crucial to eDNA research activities including an upcoming DSCRTP funded cruise to validate coral and sponge distribution models in the Gulf of Alaska (FY 2022) and anticipated work aboard a NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration cruise in Aleutian (FY 2023). The results of this study will also contribute to an existing regional efforts by NOAA and Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada to create and field test a user-friendly field guide for corals and sponges for the Northeast Pacific Ocean. The completed field guide will aid in understanding species compositions in commercial fishery and survey catches in Alaska important for management activities.

Heptopancreas samples need to be frozen IMMEDIATELY after dissection so if all crab cannot be dissected on the back deck before the next haul, please bag and tag crab in a live tank until dissections can be completed. Following dissections, retain remaining whole crab and individually bag, recording the corresponding Eppendorf tube number on the provided sample label, along with date, vessel and haul number. 

4) Eppendorf tubes should be placed in the -40°C portable freezer designated on each boat immediately following dissection. These samples are destined for lipid analysis so it is imperative that they are kept as cold as possible.

The primary goal of this project is to survey Chionoecetes bairdi and C. opilio for BCS at designated index sites within the Bering Sea. Any changes in intensity of disease within the index sites may provide information as to how the disease is affecting host populations or changing within EBS. To understand BCS trends, it is important to survey the index sites annually and with the same protocols as used in the past.

This project directly addresses stock assessment needs and NPFMC research priorities, in particular to examine population stock structure and provide life history information. 

Genetics sample collection would entail removing a 1cm x 1cm clip of fin tissue and either storing frozen or in ethanol (same as previous years). Samples can be sent to the University of Washington Fish Collection for storage. Along with the fin clip we are requesting morphometric measurements be taken and the sex recorded. Following the methods of Yano et al. 2004, morphometric data include up to 10 external measurements. We will provide detailed instructions and data sheets. The purpose of the morphometric measurements is to support the population genetics work, which has suggested two distinct sub-groups.

Treat each sleeper and salmon shark as a photo voucher (i.e., take a photo and include a photo of the label). Take length and weight data and record with specimen number on specimen form.

Genetic samples:
If there is a standard survey protocol for taking genetics samples, we would prefer to follow that procedure. We have had success with both frozen tissues and those stored in ethanol. Clip an approximately 1cm x 1cm piece of tissue from any safely accessible fin. Please ensure that there are some scales/skin on the sample so we may compare scale shape across genetic samples. The principal investigator is willing to work with RACE staff to determine the easiest method to collect and store samples. The principal investigator has contacted the staff at the University of Washington Fish collection and this collection does not fall under those already occurring for them.

Morphometric measurements:
This is for PSS ONLY. We recommend following the measurements laid out in Yano et al. 2004, which examined the systematics of the Somniosus group. We reviewed the measurements in the Yano et al. paper and prioritized 10 total measurements that will be most informative for this collection, while considering ease of collection and reducing chances of measurement error. The measurements are as follows (ranked by order of priority, if not all measurements are able to be taken), all measured in a straight line:
1 = Total Length - from tip of snout to tip of tail
2 = Pre-caudal length – from tip of snout to dorsal pre-caudal notch
3 = Depth of caudal fin notch
4 = Distance from tip of snout to anterior margin of eye
5 = Horizontal eye diameter
6 = Vertical eye diameter
7 = Distance from tip of snout to outer nostril
8 = Distance between pre-oral clefts
9 = Height of first dorsal fin
Tooth rows = count of number of rows of teeth stretching across the lower jaw 

See Figure 1 below for measurements and example data form. These data forms will be provided on plasticized paper to field staff prior to beginning of survey. 

Age structures:
This is for OBVIOUSLY DECEASED PSS ONLY. We are requesting two samples be collected as potential ageing structures: 1) both eyes; and 2) section of vertebrae. The eyes can be removed whole from the orbitals, by the easiest means available. Previous experience has shown that cutting through the chondrocranium from dorsal to ventral, around the orbital is effective. The chondrocranium in PSS is quite soft and easy to cut. A section of 4-5 vertebrae can be removed using whatever tool is preferred. Again, the vertebrae are relatively soft and a small knife can suffice, but a longer blade is probably preferred. The vertebrae should be collected from a location roughly dorsal to the pectoral fin. All structures can be bagged together and stored frozen. 

All samples will need to be labeled with species, date and location (or some identifier that will allow us to get back to the collection location, such as haul ID). Please take a picture of the whole fish with the associated specimen number label, to facilitate matching samples later. For each animal sampled, we require a minimum of sex and pre-caudal length (#2 on Figure 1) be recorded, but would also request weight and maturity details. Any pictures are welcome, but not required, of greatest interest are the ovaries and testes. Lastly, it is critical that specimen numbers match between genetics, morphometrics and age structures. We understand that due to limitations in coverage and species occurrence or susceptibility to the gear it may be difficult to obtain many samples. Salmon shark rarely occur in the trawl survey, maybe 1 or 2 fish each year (genetic samples only). There are an average of 17 PSS caught each year (genetics, morphometric and age structures).

The development of accurate and logistically feasible methods to assess fish condition and reproductive success across the large spatial scales of the marine ecosystems of Alaska would be a valuable tool for assessing the importance of habitat for commercially important species. This research project is a collaborative effort with researchers from the EBS GAP group (Prohaska et al. funded EFH proposal), the REFM Age and Growth Program (NOAA Strategic Initiative), and the Deep Sea Coral and Sponge Initiative.

Project Objectives:

1.	To develop an accurate and logistically feasible method to assess fish condition of Pacific ocean perch and northern rockfish during the bottom trawl surveys of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center.
2.	To examine the relationship between fish condition and reproductive success (fecundity) or failure (partial spawning or skipped spawning) for Pacific ocean perch and northern rockfish. 
3.	To examine the fish condition and reproductive success of these commercially important rockfish species in a variety of habitats in the Aleutian Islands, particularly habitats containing structure forming invertebrates.

An additional two days of survey time have been purchased to enable the successful completion of this project and funds are available to support the overtime of survey staff during these additional sampling periods. It is anticipated one sampling day will occur in the Samalga Pass region and one additional sampling day will occur near Seguam Island (Figure 1).  

Detailed Collection Procedures

DURING LEG 1

Sampling stations will be finalized prior to the onset of the survey based on current sampling maps and additional examination of historical survey and camera data. Current sampling locations are based on 1) initial proposed bottom trawl sampling locations for 2022 2) modeled coral density from Rooper et al. 2018, and 3) differences in model predictions and camera observations from Rooper et al. 2018 (Figure 2). 

Potential sampling areas are identified in Figure 1. Appropriate habitat areas will be identified using the map of predicted density of coral and sponge found in Rooper et al. 2018 with modifications based on their validation of these models. . Sampling will occur in known areas of coral and sponge habitat and known areas without coral and sponge habitat. If feasible, survey station tows within these areas will be used to obtain samples of Pacific ocean perch and northern rockfish. It may be necessary to do additional tows within these areas if additional sampling is needed beyond what is possible using the 2022 survey plan. Alternatively sampling tows can be chosen separately from standard survey tows.

During each sampling day, 2- 3 tows will be completed in both habitat types at at least two different locations. If standard survey tows are utilized, additional time may be needed as the tows will need to be fully processed using standard survey protocols. Pacific ocean perch and northern rockfish will be randomly sampled from each tow after the tow is processed. Up to 50 female fish of each species will be randomly sampled from each location/habitat combination. Each female fish will be examined to determine: length, weight, liver weight, and the presence of Sarcotaces parasites. A fatmeter will be used to measure lipid/water ratios. The ovary and otoliths of each fish will be collected. A subsample of fish may be collected whole and frozen for later bioenergetics or FT NIRS analyses. Additional energetic measurements will be collected throughout the survey as time allows.  If there is time a visual assessment of maturity may occur, an ovarian weight may be taken, the condition of the parasites will be documented (fresh vs old), and a photograph will be taken of the reproductive tract.

Among these are several different salmon stocks, some of which are declining in numbers, age, weight, and length despite active conservation strategies. These declines have resulted in impacts on commercial and recreational fishery economies, and generated resounding ecosystem effects. Recent evidence suggests predation may be an important mechanism for low salmon survival. However, while there has been research on the impacts of other predators (marine mammals and birds), little has been done to assess the role of salmon sharks (SS) on managed species and marine systems as a whole in the NEP. 

To assess the effect of this species on salmon and other commercially-valuable prey species, our project is designed to obtain a better understanding of SS foraging ecology. To do so, we are combining multiple methods (stable isotope analysis, stomach content analysis) to determine what prey items, and how much, the salmon sharks are eating. These analyses should provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of SS in ecosystems throughout the NEP. We will be sharing this information widely, both to the scientific community and those who are dependent on species that are likely affected by SS, such as salmon.

On the vessel with the IPHC sampler, Pacific halibut will be sampled as follows: measure the halibut using a NOAA Fisheries measuring board; weigh the halibut on a scale provided by IPHC, assess sex and maturity by making a small incision, removing the gonads, and making visual maturity assessments based on pre-determined criteria; remove the left side otolith by cutting either through the opercular opening or through the top of the head; check for prior hooking wounds through a simple external examination; and take a small fin clip for genetic sampling. 


Sub-sampling. In tows with approximately 100 or fewer Pacific halibut, all fish will be processed as described above. In tows with substantially more than 100 halibut; sort the halibut as quickly as possible into baskets once the codend is dumped. Once the sampler is satisfied that most of the halibut has been sorted out, the sampler will estimate the average number of halibut per basket, then use a random number table to choose which baskets to keep in order to make a sample of approximately 100. 

Data collection and entry. All collection data are recorded by hand onto IPHC-created forms while on deck, then entered by the IPHC sampler into a ruggedized electronic tablet supplied by IPHC. 

Where the sampling station is set up on the vessel deck is dependent on the FPC’s preference and vessel set-up, and can be determined once on board. The sampler’s primary objective will be to collect the prescribed biological data on Pacific halibut and serve as an active member of the scientific crew assisting with duties such as codend sort and processing. The sampler will work cooperatively with the FPC and Deck Boss to ensure objectives are met.  

Because of supply chain issues with the usual Tray biens used for otolith collection that the IPHC routinely provides, we are requesting the use of NOAA-prepared vials for otoliths. Labels can be placed directly in the vials and should contain year, region (i.e. BS, NBS, AI), and otolith number (beginning with “1” and consecutively numbered). The otoliths will be transferred to different containers once back in the office and containers with vials will be returned.

Specimens will be used for identifying marine species using forensic molecular genetic

species ID from eDNA. This survey is critical to the collection, because while we are increasing species coverage along the WA-CA coastline, we do not have as many specimens from Alaska, a missing component to correct analysis. 

This year we selected fish previously caught on each of the three surveys covering commercially important, bycatch, and eDNA metabarcoding interests. Additionally, in the Aleutian Island survey we are requesting certain snailfish (Careproctus sp.) to support UW's efforts to identify novel species.

Given the current limitations on sampling, we have selected a small list of species per survey. If only one survey request of the three can be accepted, our priority is the Aleutian Islands survey.

Samples are stored at the University of Washington Fish Collection, and NWFSC generated
genetic reference data is shared with all collaborative partners as well as on public databases such as Genbank and Barcode of Life (BOLD) for betterment of communal scientific knowledge.

Their diet and foraging movements are poorly understood and particularly unknown when they are feeding in the Bering Sea.This population has experienced a 20-year decline in growth rates and recently demonstrated unusual diet and location of summer aggregation in 2014 and elevated mortality rate in 2019. Climate-induced ecosystem changes are hypothesized to alter belugas’ foraging habitats and preferences, migration routes and timing, and population health, but the exact mechanism for these anomaly events remains unclear and urgently needs to be studied. The primary objective of our study is to understand present-day foraging movements and feeding preference of the Eastern Beaufort Sea beluga whales and to identify how climate change is affecting their foraging behaviors. We will investigate the major diet and feeding locations (Beaufort vs. Bering Sea, pelagic vs. benthic, etc.) of these whales by comparing multiple stable isotope tracers (carbon, nitrogen, and mercury) in beluga tissues that we already have and their potential prey items that we hope to obtain from the RACE bottom trawl survey.

Currently the initiative is in the Alaska region (2020-2023) and a research plan has been developed focusing on data and sample collection during the 2022 and 2023 field seasons. To support our understanding of the taxonomy, distribution, biology, and habitat, of deep-sea coral in Alaska waters, we propose conducting a series of collections of corals (height, weight, photos, specimens) with accompanying molecular samples to continue the development of sequence voucher libraries for corals in the Alaska region. Specimen ID’s will be contributed to the deep-sea coral database in support of the development of a multi-agency, multi-region species ID guide. Genetic sequencing from these samples is essential for development of a reference database for future environmental DNA (eDNA) research activities.

Samples should be cleaned, and photographed individually with specimen labels in the photograph for each species encountered.  For whole specimens take height and width measurements, and record weight. When collecting, each species should be placed in a separate plastic bag with the vessel#, cruise#, haul#  and identification matching the catch form written on a RACE voucher label placed in the bag following the standard RACE voucher protocol. 
Specimens should be stored in buckets of 95% ethanol.

Coral Photographs when possible
Select 1-3 species of intact coral from at least one haul per day, more if time permits. Specifically, any novel species, rare or unusual species, or species from deep stations. 
1.    Gently rinse specimen by submerging in a bucket of sea water or the live tank,
2.    Place rinsed specimen on a gridded sheet (if available) and
3.    Place specimen tag with vessel, cruise, haul number, and species identification next to the specimen,
4.    Minimize shadows and glare as much as possible
5.    Images to be taken:
    2-3 images of whole specimen (specimen should fill the camera screen),
    2-3 close-up images of polyps (use macro lens or setting), 
    2-3 close-up images of any attached fauna
Images of any abnormalities, signs of disease, or damage (other than from the trawl)
6.    Review all images before discarding/preserving the specimen
7.    Retake any blurry images or those with obstructing water spots
8.    Download all images at the end of each day, time permitting

Sandlance (Ammodytes spp.) larvae are a component of ichthyoplankton assemblages encountered in the EBS and NBS during routine plankton surveys conducted by AFSC. Only recently has genetic evidence revealed the presence of two species in the EBS, Pacific Sandlance (Ammodytes personatus) and Arctic Sandlance (A. hexapterus). Currently, larvae and early juveniles of sandlance species cannot be visually distinguished unambiguously. However, identification is possible using nucleotide sequence data or a low cost genetic protocol that was developed at the AFSC (NPRB-funded project #924). 
Therefore, we propose using genetic methods to identify sandlance larvae from the EBS and NBS in order to develop visual-based identification protocols, and adult specimens would improve our ability to capture the genetic diversity of both species, with the genetic data to be used in support of a publication. Visual-based methods rely upon rapid and accurate molecular techniques and the discovery of diagnostic characters (pigment, morphological) or meristics from identified larval specimens. The objective of this work is to compare distribution patterns of larval sandlance in the EBS, NBS and Arctic to the area of sympatry of adults in the EBS and adult sandlance will provide our project with genetic reference material.
